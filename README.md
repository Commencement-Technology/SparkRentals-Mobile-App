## About
### Background
The mobile app will allow customers to rent electric scooters. Customers may need to log in or register before they can access the service. The app presents a map with all available scooters mapped by their position. In order to be able to rent an electric scooter, the customer needs to deposit money by inserting a prepaid card with a code that contains money to top up their balance. To start a trip with a bicycle, the QR code is scanned or the bicycle is selected on the map. The app also maps all the different parking zones so the user knows where it is best to park the electric scooter after the trip and where the customer is not allowed to park their scooter anywhere.

The app will be built with React Native and retrieve data from our REST API.
